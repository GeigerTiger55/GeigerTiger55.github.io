                I am a full stack web application developer with experience using
                JavaScript, React, Express, Node, Python, Flask, PostgreSQL, and
                AWS.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have a background in mathematics, tech start up operations and
                prior experience as a developer. Over the last few years I have 
                been traveling around the world, spending time with family, and 
                exploring other passions. In that time I have missed programming 
                and problem solving. In pursuit of re-entering the developer 
                community, I recently graduated from Rithm School - a coding 
                bootcamp, and am excited to be diving back into the world of 
                coding.
            </p>
            <p>
                Aside from that, I am a volleyball player, hiker, camper and avid
                traveler. I also make a mean taco.
